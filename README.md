# monunet
A model that accurately detects architectural heritage sites of any city based on the given dataset. I have used [my own dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/archis2004/monument-dataset) of monuments in the city of Kolkata , however the neural network model works for any heritage dataset and predicts the monument with an accuracy of upto 95%. The notebook was made online on Kaggle.
